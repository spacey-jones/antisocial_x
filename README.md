The 🐑**antisocial_x** extension creates a truly neutral browsing experience on X (fka Twitter), 
allowing users to engage with content based solely on its inherent value, without any influence 
from visible engagement metrics, follower counts, or social proof indicators. 

It preserves the ability for users to like and comment on posts, maintaining the core interactive 
features of the platform while removing all potential influences of popularity metrics.
